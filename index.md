## Welcome to the Vincent-Ruz Lab

We are a Chemistry Education Research Group at ______________. Our research builds an understanding of how systemic disadvantages hinder the success of marginalized students in Chemistry. Specifically, how these barriers on access, opportunity, and social messaging impact their science-related attitudes, engagement with the learning environment, and retention.

Overall, our approach to effective Chemistry Education plays close attention to equity and justice. That is, it gives equal value to the knowledge/practices that are the (ever-expanding) current foundation of the Chemistry field, and knowledge/practices that will position our students to succeed and change a scientific culture that has a long history of reproducing systemic injustices.
